<h1>Smart Parkimg System</h1>
This Problem statement was given at TechGig Code Gladiator Finale round hosted at Navi mumbai office.
Traffic congestion caused by vehicle is an alarming problem at a global scale and it has been growing exponentially. Car parking problem is a major contributor and has been, still a major problem with increasing vehicle size in the luxurious segment and confined parking spaces in urban cities. Searching for a parking space is a routine (and often frustrating) activity for many people in cities around the world and contributes to loss of time and money, stress for the drivers as well environmental impact due to unnecessary fuel burning. 
Smart Parking systems can be a boon in such scenarios. They can be deployed to obtain information about available parking spaces in a particular geographic area and process in real-time to place vehicles at available parking spots. With the help of smart parking system, there would be no congestion in parking lot because the available slot is given by our smart parking app.
As part of this challenge we have tried to built a brain for a smart parking app using image processing and machine learning using python libraries. Our project takes the image of a parking lot and at any time can provide the list of total parking spaces and how many available for parking.
